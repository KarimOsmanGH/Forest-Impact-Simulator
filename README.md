## üßÆ Calculations

### **Carbon Sequestration (Planting Mode)**

**Single Tree:**
```
Carbon = Base Rate (kg CO‚ÇÇ/year)
```

**Multiple Trees with Percentage Distribution:**
```
Carbon = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Soil Modifier
```

**Multiple Trees with Equal Distribution:**
```
Carbon = (Œ£ Tree_i) / n + Soil Modifier
```

**Environmental Modifiers:**
```
Soil Modifier = Soil Carbon (g/kg) √ó 0.1
```

### **Carbon Emissions (Clear-cutting Mode)**

**Immediate Carbon Release:**
```
Immediate Release = Œ£(Base Rate √ó Growth Factor(year)) for year 1 to tree_age
```

**Lost Future Sequestration:**
```
Lost Future = Œ£(Base Rate √ó Growth Factor(tree_age + year)) for year 1 to simulation_years
```

**Total Carbon Emissions:**
```
Total Emissions = Immediate Release + Lost Future Sequestration
```

**Tree Age Growth Factors:**
```
Age 1: 5% of mature rate
Age 2: 15% of mature rate  
Age 3: 30% of mature rate
Age 4: 50% of mature rate
Age 5: 70% of mature rate
Age 6: 85% of mature rate
Age 7-20: 95% of mature rate (mature trees)
Age 21-50: 90% of mature rate (older mature trees)
Age 50+: 85% of mature rate (very old trees)
```

**Note**: Clear-cutting mode calculates immediate carbon release as the total carbon stored in the tree over its lifetime (representing all carbon released when the tree is cut down) plus lost future sequestration (carbon that would have been absorbed over the simulation period). This provides realistic emission estimates based on the actual age and carbon storage of trees being removed.

### **Environmental Impact Calculations**

**Water Retention & Air Quality:**
- **Planting Mode**: Improve over time (+0.3% and +0.7% per year respectively) and scale with forest size
- **Clear-cutting Mode**: Immediately negative air quality impact (-10% to -30% based on forest size), then degrades further over time (-1.0% per year). Can reach -80% indicating severe air quality deterioration.

**Biodiversity & Forest Resilience:**
- **Planting Mode**: Improve over time (+0.05 and +0.03 per year respectively) and scale with forest size
- **Clear-cutting Mode**: Degrade over time (-0.05 and -0.03 per year respectively) and scale with forest size

**Social Impact:**
- **Planting Mode**: Positive social benefits (3.5/5 base score, improves over time)
- **Clear-cutting Mode**: Negative social impacts (2.0/5 base score, degrades over time)

**Land Use Impact:**
- **Planting Mode**: Positive improvements (erosion reduction, soil improvement, habitat creation)
- **Clear-cutting Mode**: Negative impacts (erosion increase, soil degradation, habitat loss)

**Real-world Comparisons:**
```
Car Emissions: Average car emits ~4.6 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
Flight Emissions: One round-trip NY-London flight emits ~986 kg CO‚ÇÇ
Household Electricity: Average US household emits ~7.5 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
```

**Realistic Growth Model:**
```
Year 1-3: Establishment phase (5-15% of mature rate)
Year 4-10: Rapid growth phase (15-80% of mature rate)
Year 11-20: Maturation phase (80-95% of mature rate)
Year 20+: Mature phase (95-100% of mature rate)
```

**Annual Carbon Calculation:**
```
Annual Carbon = Mature Rate √ó Growth Factor (based on year)
```

### **Climate Prediction**

**Temperature Trend Analysis:**
```
Historical Data = 5 years of temperature records (optimized for performance)
Linear Regression = Calculate temperature trend (¬∞C/year)
Future Temperature = Current + (Trend √ó Years)
```

**Growth Modifier:**
```
Temperature Change = Future Temp - Current Temp
Growth Modifier = 1 + (Temperature Change √ó 0.02)
```

**Regional Estimates (fallback):**
```
Tropical: 25¬∞C, Temperate: 15¬∞C, Boreal: 5¬∞C, Arctic: -5¬∞C
```

**Cumulative Calculation:**
```
Total Carbon = Œ£(Annual Rate √ó Growth Factor for each year)
```

### **Planting Timeline**

**Project Scale Classification:**
```
< 1,000 trees: Small-scale (Community/Backyard)
1,000-10,000 trees: Medium-scale (Local Restoration)
10,000-100,000 trees: Large-scale (Commercial Forestry)
100,000-1M trees: Very Large-scale (Regional Restoration)
> 1M trees: Massive-scale (National/International)
```

**Planting Rates by Scale:**
```
Small-scale: 50 trees/person/day, 2 people, 30 days/year
Medium-scale: 200 trees/person/day, 5 people, 60 days/year
Large-scale: 500 trees/person/day, 10 people, 90 days/year
Very Large-scale: 800 trees/person/day, 25 people, 120 days/year
Massive-scale: 1,000 trees/person/day, 50 people, 150 days/year
```

### **Biodiversity Impact**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Biodiversity = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Local Enhancement
```

**Local Enhancement:**
```
Local Enhancement = 0.2 (if local species detected)
Final Biodiversity = min(Biodiversity, 5.0)
```

### **Forest Resilience**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Resilience = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Climate Factor
```

**Climate Factor:**
```
Climate Factor = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.001
Final Resilience = min(Resilience, 5.0)
```

### **Water Retention**

**Progressive Improvement:**
```
Base Retention = 70-85% (based on latitude)
Annual Improvement = 0.3% per year
Precipitation Bonus = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.01
Water Retention = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.3) + Bonus, 95%)
```

### **Air Quality Impact**

**Planting Mode - Progressive Enhancement:**
```
Base Quality = 60%
Annual Improvement = 0.7% per year
Air Quality = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.7), 95%)
```

**Clear-cutting Mode - Immediate Negative Impact:**
```
Immediate Impact = -10% to -30% (based on forest size)
Annual Degradation = -1.0% per year
Air Quality = max(-80, -(Immediate Impact + (Years √ó 1.0)))
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### **Q: Why does air quality show negative values in clear-cutting mode?**
A: When trees are cut down, air quality immediately degrades because you're removing the air-cleaning benefits of trees. The negative values (-10% to -80%) represent air quality deterioration.

### **Q: How do I import CSV data into R or Python?**
A: The CSV export is now in standard tabular format. Use `read.csv()` in R or `pd.read_csv()` in Python. See `examples/csv_usage_examples.md` for detailed examples.

### **Q: Why is immediate carbon release sometimes larger than total emissions?**
A: This was a display formatting bug that has been fixed. Total emissions should always be larger than immediate release (immediate + lost future sequestration). Note: Immediate release now represents the total carbon stored in the tree over its lifetime, which can be substantial for mature trees.

### **Q: Can I analyze multiple tree species at once?**
A: Yes! Select multiple tree types and specify percentage distributions. The simulator will calculate weighted averages for all impact metrics.

### **Q: How accurate are the carbon sequestration rates?**
A: Based on IPCC data with species-specific adjustments. Rates vary by tree age, climate, and local conditions. Always consult local forestry experts for project-specific planning.

### **Q: How is immediate carbon release calculated in clear-cutting mode?**
A: Immediate carbon release represents the total carbon stored in the tree over its entire lifetime (sum of all annual sequestration from year 1 to current age). This is the carbon that gets released when the tree is cut down, which can be substantial for mature trees (hundreds of kg CO‚ÇÇ).
