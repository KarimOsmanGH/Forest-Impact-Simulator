## üßÆ Calculations

### **Carbon Sequestration**

**Single Tree:**
```
Carbon = Base Rate (kg CO‚ÇÇ/year)
```

**Multiple Trees with Percentage Distribution:**
```
Carbon = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Soil Modifier
```

**Multiple Trees with Equal Distribution:**
```
Carbon = (Œ£ Tree_i) / n + Soil Modifier
```

**Environmental Modifiers:**
```
Soil Modifier = Soil Carbon (g/kg) √ó 0.1
```

**Real-world Comparisons:**
```
Car Emissions: Average car emits ~4.6 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
Flight Emissions: One round-trip NY-London flight emits ~986 kg CO‚ÇÇ
Household Electricity: Average US household emits ~7.5 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
```

**Realistic Growth Model:**
```
Year 1: 5% of mature rate
Year 2: 15% of mature rate
Year 3: 30% of mature rate
Year 4: 50% of mature rate
Year 5: 70% of mature rate
Year 6: 85% of mature rate
Year 7+: 95% of mature rate (approaching full maturity)
```

**Cumulative Calculation:**
```
Total Carbon = Œ£(Annual Rate √ó Growth Factor for each year)
```

### **Biodiversity Impact**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Biodiversity = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Local Enhancement
```

**Local Enhancement:**
```
Local Enhancement = 0.2 (if local species detected)
Final Biodiversity = min(Biodiversity, 5.0)
```

### **Forest Resilience**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Resilience = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Climate Factor
```

**Climate Factor:**
```
Climate Factor = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.001
Final Resilience = min(Resilience, 5.0)
```

### **Water Retention**

**Progressive Improvement:**
```
Base Retention = 70-85% (based on latitude)
Annual Improvement = 0.3% per year
Precipitation Bonus = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.01
Water Retention = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.3) + Bonus, 95%)
```

### **Air Quality Improvement**

**Progressive Enhancement:**
```
Base Quality = 60%
Annual Improvement = 0.7% per year
Air Quality = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.7), 95%)
```

### **Mathematical Notation**

- **Œ£**: Summation across all selected tree species
- **Tree_i**: Carbon sequestration rate of tree species i
- **Percentage_i**: User-specified percentage for tree species i
- **n**: Number of selected tree species
- **Years**: Simulation duration in years
- **min()**: Function returning the minimum value (capping at maximum)
