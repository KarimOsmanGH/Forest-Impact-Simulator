## üßÆ Calculations

### **Carbon Sequestration**

**Single Tree:**
```
Carbon = Base Rate (kg CO‚ÇÇ/year)
```

**Multiple Trees with Percentage Distribution:**
```
Carbon = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Soil Modifier
```

**Multiple Trees with Equal Distribution:**
```
Carbon = (Œ£ Tree_i) / n + Soil Modifier
```

**Environmental Modifiers:**
```
Soil Modifier = Soil Carbon (g/kg) √ó 0.1
```

**Real-world Comparisons:**
```
Car Emissions: Average car emits ~4.6 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
Flight Emissions: One round-trip NY-London flight emits ~986 kg CO‚ÇÇ
Household Electricity: Average US household emits ~7.5 metric tons CO‚ÇÇ/year
```

**Realistic Growth Model:**
```
Year 1-3: Establishment phase (5-15% of mature rate)
Year 4-10: Rapid growth phase (15-80% of mature rate)
Year 11-20: Maturation phase (80-95% of mature rate)
Year 20+: Mature phase (95-100% of mature rate)
```

**Annual Carbon Calculation:**
```
Annual Carbon = Mature Rate √ó Growth Factor (based on year)
```

### **Climate Prediction**

**Temperature Trend Analysis:**
```
Historical Data = 11 years of temperature records
Linear Regression = Calculate temperature trend (¬∞C/year)
Future Temperature = Current + (Trend √ó Years)
```

**Growth Modifier:**
```
Temperature Change = Future Temp - Current Temp
Growth Modifier = 1 + (Temperature Change √ó 0.02)
```

**Regional Estimates (fallback):**
```
Tropical: 25¬∞C, Temperate: 15¬∞C, Boreal: 5¬∞C, Arctic: -5¬∞C
```

**Cumulative Calculation:**
```
Total Carbon = Œ£(Annual Rate √ó Growth Factor for each year)
```

### **Planting Timeline**

**Project Scale Classification:**
```
< 1,000 trees: Small-scale (Community/Backyard)
1,000-10,000 trees: Medium-scale (Local Restoration)
10,000-100,000 trees: Large-scale (Commercial Forestry)
100,000-1M trees: Very Large-scale (Regional Restoration)
> 1M trees: Massive-scale (National/International)
```

**Planting Rates by Scale:**
```
Small-scale: 50 trees/person/day, 2 people, 30 days/year
Medium-scale: 200 trees/person/day, 5 people, 60 days/year
Large-scale: 500 trees/person/day, 10 people, 90 days/year
Very Large-scale: 800 trees/person/day, 25 people, 120 days/year
Massive-scale: 1,000 trees/person/day, 50 people, 150 days/year
```

### **Biodiversity Impact**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Biodiversity = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Local Enhancement
```

**Local Enhancement:**
```
Local Enhancement = 0.2 (if local species detected)
Final Biodiversity = min(Biodiversity, 5.0)
```

### **Forest Resilience**

**Base Calculation:**
```
Resilience = Œ£(Tree_i √ó Percentage_i / 100) + Climate Factor
```

**Climate Factor:**
```
Climate Factor = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.001
Final Resilience = min(Resilience, 5.0)
```

### **Water Retention**

**Progressive Improvement:**
```
Base Retention = 70-85% (based on latitude)
Annual Improvement = 0.3% per year
Precipitation Bonus = Annual Precipitation (mm) √ó 0.01
Water Retention = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.3) + Bonus, 95%)
```

### **Air Quality Improvement**

**Progressive Enhancement:**
```
Base Quality = 60%
Annual Improvement = 0.7% per year
Air Quality = min(Base + (Years √ó 0.7), 95%)
```

### **Mathematical Notation**

- **Œ£**: Summation across all selected tree species
- **Tree_i**: Carbon sequestration rate of tree species i
- **Percentage_i**: User-specified percentage for tree species i
- **n**: Number of selected tree species
- **Years**: Simulation duration in years
- **min()**: Function returning the minimum value (capping at maximum)
